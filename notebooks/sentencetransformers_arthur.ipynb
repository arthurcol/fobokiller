      " ambience here is star but in my opinion this is an expensive tourist trap. the moment you enter you feel like you have been transported to the south of france but, it sort of stops there. the service is ok and arrogant. they had run out of many items on the menu by the time we arrived. the menu cards in english were a bit of a giveaway for me. it was expensive mains and many of the dishes i wanted to order were not available. the wine list is small and has some ok wines in it. the red we had was ordinary and, the lack of proven√ßal aperitifs also, equally disappointing. i had the petit pots for starter which was ok. four dips in pots with breads. it did not blow me away in anyway. my main of whole fish was also ok and slightly overcooked. they forgot to bring my sides for the whole meal and i was left with a whole fish and nothing else. my cafe gourmand was the highlight of the evening and the chocolate mousse was to die for. i don't think i would come back here again. paris is one of my favourite cities to eat out as, there is such an extensive culinary scene here. i am confident i can do way better for a lot less money, in this town. i will leave this place for the people who want to pay a lot of money for ok food :-)) see all photos from sam s. for le sud \n",

      "just had dinner here and the food and service were great! the atmosphere is cozy and charming, replicating the south of france (hence the restaurant name). the servers were very attentive and took time to explain the menu to each table. we realized one of our servers was also one of the restaurant owners. we ate the lamb confit and seafood platter which were delicious! it is a little pricey, but definitely worth the experience. \n",
      " great atmosphere and friendly service. the staff don't speak a lot of english as others have mentioned. but they do have english menu. i ordered the la bourride which is a melting pot (literally came in a hot pot) of tender seafood simmering in a very smooth but not over-flavored broth. it was a hit and the broth goes well with the special garlic? butter bread that come with the dish. i had wanted to try their creme burlee but will have to wait for the next time. will definely come back and try some if their dishes like the lamb confit. la bourride. \n",

      "this is not your traditional parisian cooking style.... this restaurant is a full on southern france cuisine. we were looking for a good boulliabese .... and here at le sud they have the boulliabese version also from southern france and is called bourride. is almost the same but thickened with egg yolks. this is a most have. it was delicious! as appetizer i recommend the salmon tartare and the small whiting fish. for main courses we had filet de daurade, entrecote and the bourride which i already told you it was awesome. the fish came on bed of vegetables cooked perfectly.  desserts here are very good as well.... rich and creamy homemade icecream, and one that they called coffee and petit desserts, which as it says comes with a mini version of tiramisu, lemon custard, chocolate mousse and coffee. all very good. my favorite were chocolate icecream and pistachio icecream. needless to say that service here is very, very good. the restaurant itself is beautiful, just like walking into a southern garden in the middle of marseille. in my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in paris. affordable and with a unique charm. \n",
