       "   'i went to blend thinking that i\\'d finally find the perfect burger in paris since i heard that the owner lived in the us and wanted to create a burger as good as in the us. i used to live in la and manhattan so i have always tried to taste the \"best burgers\" around the us. the place really tries to be something hype like a little cool place in bowery but it just feels so fake. the servers are just too cool to get your order. i just rather eat somewhere simple than somewhere faking to be hype when they are not. the bun is probably one of the best in paris and i liked the proportion meatbreadcheese the problem is that the burger is bland. you can\\'t say that it\\'s awful but the flavor is just not there. i guess that they do that so you can spend more and more money on sauces(yes they charge extra) to get some flavor. the sweet potato fries are usually my favorite but there they\\'re just burned and mushy not crispy and tasteful like they should be (who knows umami burger or father\\'s office ones in la knows what i\\'m talking about). also you just have one choice of sauce with it (it comes in a really small container) and don\\'t even think about asking for some ketchup because you\\'ll need to pay extra. i\\'m still in search for some good sweet potato fries in paris and as for the burger i\\'d rather go to b&m (avenue parmentier)!',\n",
       "   'i went to blend with my wife, daughter and brother. i ordered the signature burger, my wife and brother got the west and our little one had the cheesy. first off the service was very nice, smiling and accommodating. my daughter has egg allergy and when we explained that to the waitress she was pretty quick to let us know that all their buns (made in-house) having eggs they would be happy to prepare \"bunless-burgers\" whichever style we want. now to the food, the signature was very tender, juicy, all you want from a successful burger. the caramelized onions were delicious and also the in-house prepared bun. my only criticism would be that they tend to overcook the meat. i love burger with a medium rare beef however the meat came more like medium. but other than this it was a very solid burger. the west was really nice too, melty and again the toasted, upside-down bun was delicious. only criticism here would be that again it was a little more cooked than what we asked for and also a bit too much seasoning (saltpepper) was added to the patty. my feeling regarding the cooking is that because they have so many english speaking among their customers who typically prefer meat to be overcooked than undercooked, this creates a bias in the way they prepare their patties. but i could be totally wrong and i did not ask them directly the question :) all in all, a very nice burger place, the setup is pretty small (there are like tables for all in all) but cozy. try to come close to opening time for lunch (pm) if you dont want to wait too long. if like me you have a strong preference to how cooked your meat is i would advise you to really make sure to indicate it when you order and maybe to give them a notch below your desired degree (rare for medium-rare etc...)',\n",
